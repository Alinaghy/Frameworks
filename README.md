The most popular Mobile and Web frameworks

## Software framework 
In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing applicationspecific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions.

## Frontend and backend 
In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend (or sometimes referred to as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.
